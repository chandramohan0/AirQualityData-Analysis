# Air Quality Data in India

This repository contains a project that analyzes air quality data for different cities in India using the Pandas library in Python. The data includes information such as the levels of various air pollutants, such as NO2, SO2, and CO, for different cities over several years. The Jupyter Notebook contains the code for loading, cleaning, and exploring the data and creating various visualizations to understand the trends in air quality in India.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites

You need to have the following packages installed on your system:

* NumPy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn

You can install them by running the following command in your terminal:

```
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

## Installing

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/chandramohan0/PythonZeroToPandasProject-AirQualityDataInIndia.git
```

## Running the analysis

The analysis can be run using the Jupyter Notebook `PythonZeroToPandasProject-AirQualityDataInIndia.ipynb`. The code will load the air quality data, clean the data, explore the data, and create visualizations to understand the trends in air quality in India.

## Built With

* [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) - A library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices.
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) - A library for the Python programming language, providing easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools.
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) - A plotting library for the Python programming language.
* [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) - A data visualization library based on Matplotlib.
